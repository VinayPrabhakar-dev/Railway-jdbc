# Railway Reservation System using JDBC

This repository contains a console-based railway reservation system implemented in Java. The project utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection between the Java application and a database management system (DBMS) for efficient data retrieval and storage.

## Key Features

- **Menu-Driven Interface:** The project provides a user-friendly console-based menu system that allows users to navigate through various functionalities easily.
- **Admin Panel:** An admin panel is available to manage system operations, such as adding new trains, updating train details, and deleting trains from the system.
- **Train Enquiry:** Users can inquire about available trains by specifying the source and destination stations. The system displays relevant train information, including train number, departure time, arrival time, and available seats.
- **User Login:** Users can create an account and log in to the system using their credentials. This allows for personalized ticket booking and reservation management.
- **Ticket Booking:** Logged-in users can book tickets by providing details such as the train number, date of travel, and passenger information. The system validates seat availability and updates the database accordingly.
- **Reservation Management:** Logged-in users can manage their reservations by viewing booked tickets, canceling reservations, or modifying passenger details.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to users, enhancing the system's robustness and reliability.
